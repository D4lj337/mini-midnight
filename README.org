* mini-midnight
A minimal, modern dark theme for Emacs with sensible defaults and support for
common packages (*vertico, marginalia, corfu, doom-modeline, flycheck, magit,
eshell, vterm, org*, etc.). Designed to be low-contrast, readable, and
compatible with stock Emacs and popular configurations.

* Features
- Compact, low-contrast palette with readable syntax highlighting
- Faces for completion UIs (corfu/vertico/marginalia), consult previews
- Support for flycheck/flymake diagnostics and magit diff faces
- ANSI/terminal color vector set for consistent shells
- Safe refresh hooks to update icon/caches when the theme is enabled

* Installation

1. Install from GitHub with elpaca + `use-package` 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package mini-midnight
  :ensure (:host github :repo "d4lj337/mini-midnight")
  :hook  (emacs-startup . (lambda () (load-theme 'mini-midnight t))))
#+end_src

* Usage
Enable the theme with:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-theme 'mini-midnight t)
#+end_src

If you update icons or completion packages and colors look stale, the theme
includes guarded refresh hooks that attempt to reset common icon/caches
(kind-icon, all-the-icons, corfu, vterm).
